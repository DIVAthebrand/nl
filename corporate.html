  <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <p>Our testing goal  
It is important that people know what we stand for and what we want to achieve and that people know where to find everything on the website. It is important that everything is clear.  
<br> <br> 
We will record what our participants has to say about our website. We let them test the website and see if they can find everything and if it's easy to use. It will be recorded and some of the testing will be done remotely and some in person. The testing will be in Dutch since our participants first language is Dutch which makes it easier for them.  
<br> <br> 
Instruction question:<br> 
1. If you want to a be member of DIVA, where do you click? <br> 
2. You want to know more about what DIVA is, where do you go? <br> 
3. You want to read a blog about how to find more time as a mom, where do you go? <br> 
4. So you’re more interested and want to follow our Instagram page, can you find us? <br> 
5. You want to know who are behind DIVA <br> 
6. What do you think of our design, color scheme? <br> 
7. What do you think could be more improved? <br> 
<br> 
Testing results <br> 
1. Everyone liked the colorscheme and how the website looks in overall <br> 
2. Easy to use <br> 
3. More visuals (pictures, videos) <br> 
4. Blog posts page is very nice <br> 
5. The blog post topics are interesting and relevant <br> 
6. You can find everything <br> 
7. The page for becoming a member does not lead to anything <br><br>
It was a little bit difficult to do it remotely, so for the next time we will do it more in person. In a short time it was difficult to find someone of our target group in our area with who we could test in person. <br> <br> 
 
We added more pictures and for the next time will add more video’s to make it more dynamic.  </p>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

  <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our brand is about empowering women to overcome mom guilt and inspiring them to follow their passions. To promote this idea, we posted content with quotes and tips for moms to get inspired to live their best life, or raised awareness for how common it is for moms to feel guilty, and what they can do to overcome such “Mom Guilt”. We also posted content to promote the blogs on our website.  </p>
          <p>We mainly used Instagram as our channel, but also posted our content on Facebook.  
			We decided upon this after doing research into the platforms our target group uses the most. Also during our problem interviews we asked the target group what social media channels they used most frequently, and they told us Instagram and Facebook are their favourite platforms.
				<br><br>
				Our reach objectives were: 100 followers, 1000 reach and 2000 impressions by the end of April. To reach this objective, we used a lot of hashtags in our caption and followed accounts that make content for the same target audience.
<br><br>Our affect objectives were to make our target audience feel understood and supported because we learned during our first interviews that moms often feel a bit alone and helpless. We tried to reach this objective by raising awareness for mom guilt and providing tips on how to overcome this. 
<br><br>Our response objective was to get people to visit our website and read our blog posts. We did this by posting the cover of our blog post on Instagram, and telling the audience to visit our website via the link in our bio.  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We planned on using the platforms Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest. We soon found out that Instagram was the best platform to use for our campaign, because we the reach per post was the highest on this platform. We failed on using Pinterest, because it took us too long to create the blog post page on or website to actually use it as platform for this campaign and link it with Pinterest. We learned that using a lot of hashtags helps a lot to attract more audience. We first only used hashtags that aligned with the content of our post, like:  
<br><br>  
#balans #moederzijn #familie #werk #mama #moeder #momlife #moederschap #ouderschap #kinderen #baby #ouders #oudersvannu #opvoeding #kind #mamablogger #mamazijn #bewustouderschap #opvoedtips #zwangerschap #gezin #motherhood #peuter #opvoeden #parenting #liefde #moederliefde #familie #gelukkigeoudersgelukkigekinderen&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br> 
This was before we were informed that all of our content should be in English. After that, we started posting in English and also started using English and more general hashtags. Our hashtags looked like this: 
<br><br> 
#likes #like #follow #likeforlikes #love #instagood #instagram #followme #instalike #instadaily #followers #likeforlike #comment #mom #motherhood #time #timemanagement #momguilt #momlife #mama #family #happy #life #lifestyle #blog 
<br><br>  
This however did not have a very big impact on the amount of people that saw our post. The post that performed best was the one where we gave tips on hobby’s for busy moms. This post was posted on the 22nd of March, and had an engagement rate of 52.17%, which can be linked to the fact that is was a carousel post.  
<br><br>  
Our post with the highest reach was the first post to promote our blog, which had a reach of 98. This can be linked to the fact that we used a lot of hashtags under that post, which attracted a lot of viewers.  
<br><br>   
We had expected to gain more followers, and also to reach more people with our posts.  
<br><br>  
Using a tool like Hootsuite was really helpful, because it made it easy to have regular posting and keep track of how our posts performed.  
<br><br>  
We had expected that our reels post would get a higher reach, however this did not happen, which surprised us. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we were to continue to promote this brand, we would launch our Mother’s Day campaign. This was the idea from the beginning on, but we realized that is was too early to start a Mother’s Day campaign in March. Since our post with series recommendations did very well, we would make more posts in this style, maybe with recommendations for Mother’s Day activities, or gift inspiration.  
Since we failed to use Pinterest in the last couple of weeks, we would make sure our website is fully launched so we can better link everything and see if this helps to attract more people to our Instagram page as well.<br><br> 
On the 8th of April, these were our statistics: <br>
Page & profile reach: 306<br>
Post reach: 410<br>
Page & profile impressions: 551<br>
Post impressions: 433<br>
Followers: 35<br><br>
Therefore our new reach objectives would be:  <br>
80 Followers <br>
800 Reach <br>
800 Impressions <br><br>
We would not change our affect and response objectives, since these are still the things we stand for as a brand and people seem to like it.  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
