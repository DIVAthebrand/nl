		  <h1>Recognition</h1><br>
		  <h5 class="value">Motherhood is a demanding and often thankless job that requires a tremendous amount of time, energy and emotional labor. Recognition and appreciation for these efforts can go a long way in making mothers feel valued and respected. It can also help to combat feelings of isolation and loneliness that sometimes come with motherhood. By acknowledging the hard work and dedication that goes into being a mother, others can help to create a sense of community and support for mothers who may be struggling. Also, recognition can help mothers in terms of their own self-esteem and sense of accomplishment. Receiving recognition and praise for their job as mom can help to boost their confidence and sense of self-worth. </h5>

        <h1>Self-Respect</h1><br>
		  <h5 class="value">Mothers with self-respect are better equipped to set and enforce healthy boundaries with their children and others in their lives. This can help them to avoid feeling resentful or becoming overwhelmed by their responsibilities. When mothers have a strong sense of self-respect, they are more likely to feel confident and empowered in their role as a parent. This can help them make difficult decisions, stand up for their children, and provide the guidance and support their children need to thrive.</h5>

      <div>
		  <h1>Personality</h1><br>
		  <h5 class="value">By focusing on their personality, a mom can manage her time and responsibilities more effectively, because by understanding her own personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses, she can identify what tasks are most important to her and focus her time and energy on them. With a well-developed personality, moms are less likely to put their own needs last, because they recognize the importance of self-care. By understanding her personality, a mom can identify the activities that bring her joy and relaxation and prioritize them in her busy schedule.</h5>
