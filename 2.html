  <p class="text"><strong><em>As a mom it can already be challenging to find time for yourself, let alone for your hobbies and passions. It is, however, crucial for your mental health and wellbeing to take time for yourself. In this blogpost we will share tips to make finding time for your hobbies and passions easier, also as a busy mom. </em></strong><br>
<br>
Make a schedule. 
One of the most effective ways to make time for your hobbies and passions is by making a schedule. Plan time for hobbies and passions the same way you would plan in time for work or activities with your family. This can be a daily, weekly or monthly schedule. 
 <br><br>
Find small pockets of time. 
Finding small pockets of time throughout your day can add up to significant chunks of time for pursuing your hobbies and passions. Get up a bit earlier or carve out some time later on the evening to practice your hobby. Use your lunch break or traveling time to read, write, or listen to podcasts that relate to your passion.  
 <br><br>
Ask your family or partner for help. 
Asking for help from your partner or family members can also help you to make time for your hobbies and passions. Ask your partner to take on some of the household responsibilities or ask your family to help babysit while you work on your passion project. 
 <br><br>
Set boundaries. 
Setting boundaries is essential to making time for your hobbies and passions. Let your family know you need time to yourself and ask them to respect your boundaries. Turn off your phone and find a quiet place to work on your hobby without distractions. 
 <br><br>
Make your hobby a family activity. 
Finally, consider making your hobby a family activity. This can be a great way to spend quality time together while pursuing passion. For example, if you like gardening, involve your family in planting a vegetable garden, or if you like taking walks, take a long walk with your family as company. 
<br><br>
In a busy mom's schedule, making time for hobbies and passions can sound like an impossible task, but these 5 tips can make it a little easier. Remember that time for yourself is important for your mental health and well-being and can make you a better mom in the long run. Because if you canâ€™t take care of yourself, how are you going to take care of someone else?
