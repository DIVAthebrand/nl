	</div>  
	  
 <div>
  <p class="text"><strong><em>Many moms experience "mom guilt" - the feeling of not being good enough, not doing enough, or not being present enough for their children. This guilt can be all-consuming and can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and burnout. If you're struggling with mom-guilt, there are several strategies you can use to cope and overcome these feelings. </em></strong>
	  <br><br>
Practice self-compassion. 
One of the most important things you can do to deal with mom-guilt is to practice self-compassion. Recognize that you're not perfect, and that's okay. It's normal to make mistakes, and it's okay to take care of yourself too. When you feel guilty, try to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would show a friend who was going through a difficult time.
<br><br>
Focus on what you're doing well. 
When you're feeling guilty, it's easy to focus on all the things you're not doing well. Instead, try to focus on the things you are doing well. Make a list of your accomplishments as a mother, no matter how small they may seem. This can help you see that you're doing a good job and give you the confidence to continue. 
 <br><br>
Set realistic expectations. 
It's important to set realistic expectations for yourself as a mother. Don't compare yourself to other moms, or to some idealized version of what a mother should be. Instead, focus on what works for you and your family. Set goals that are achievable and be kind to yourself when you fall short. 
 <br><br>
Practice self-care. 
Taking care of yourself is essential when dealing with mom-guilt. Make time for yourself every day, even if it's just a few minutes. Do something that makes you feel good, whether it's taking a bath, going for a walk, or reading a book. When you take care of yourself, you'll be better able to take care of your children. 
 <br><br>
Connect with other moms. 
Connecting with other moms can be a great way to cope with mom guilt. Talking to other moms who are going through similar experiences can help you feel less alone and give you new ideas and strategies for dealing with your feelings. Joining a mom's group or online community can be a good way to find other moms to connect with. Remember that the DIVA community will always have your back, so don’t hesitate to reach out to us! 
 <br><br>
Seek support.  
If you're struggling with mom-guilt, don't be afraid to seek support. Talk to your partner, a friend, or a therapist about how you're feeling. Sometimes just talking about your feelings can help you feel better, and a professional can provide additional strategies and support. If you want more tips on how you can ask your friends and family for support, read or latest blog post “How to support moms”.  
In conclusion, mom guilt is a common experience for many mothers. But with the right strategies and support, you can learn to cope and overcome these feelings. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and that's all anyone can ask for. </p>
