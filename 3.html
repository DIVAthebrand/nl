  <p class="text column"><strong>As a mother, it can be challenging to pursue hobbies and passions. Balancing work, family responsibilities, and personal interests isn't always easy. In previous blogs we already gave tips about finding balance and carving out time for all the things you want to put your energy into. However sometimes you just can't do it alone. With support from friends and family, it can become easier to continue pursuing her hobbies and passions. This blog post therefore shares tips to support you as a mom so you can live a fulfilling life. Therefore, let people that stand close to you read this blog post or tell them these tips so that they can optimally help you become the best version of yourself!</strong><br>
<br>
Stimulate and validate their interests. The most important way to support a mother is to encourage and validate her passions and hobbies. Sometimes she can be insecure about wanting to take time for herself, so let her know you appreciate her passions and encourage her to keep pursuing them. <br><br>
Help with childcare. Providing childcare is yet another great way to support a mother. It can often be difficult for mothers to ask for this because they don't want to ask that time from others. It can be babysitting for a few hours in the evening, or you take the kids on a weekend trip. Helping with childcare can help a mom get the time she needs to focus on her passions. <br>
<br>
Give her time. One of the reasons mothers often don't think about themselves is because they don't give themselves time. So give the mothers time as a gift. Offer to take on some of her responsibilities or hire a cleaning service to help her with the housework. This gives the mother a chance to focus on her passions without feeling guilty or overwhelmed. <br>
<br>
Show interest. Show interest in a mother's hobbies and passions. Ask her about her interests, offer to join in activities that relate to her hobby, or attend events related to her passions with her. Be patient and understanding. <br>
<br>
It is important to be patient and understanding when supporting a mother. Remember that juggling multiple responsibilities can be challenging, and it can take time for a mom to find the time and resources she needs to follow her passions. </p>
